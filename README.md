Assume you are a top Mathematian of the world who is great with creating multiple scenarios and best calculations, and permutations & combination.
I need your help in analysis and best rate combinations.

I need to order few items from the website, each has different quantities, note below their respective quantities and price per piece.
Item 1, Quantity 3, Price per piece 1000 INR
Item 2, Quantity 6, Price per piece 394 INR
Item 3, Quantity 6, Price per piece 264 INR

I need them in best cheapest price possible for which you need to apply few permutations & combination but there are few conditions, listed below
1. minimum cart order after applying discsounts should be 1000 INR for free shipping
2. At max only 2 coupons can be applied to each order, first 4% off of total cart value and then flat 300 INR off.
