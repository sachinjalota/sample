Incremental in the sense which data is added or update after last update. I do have updated_at column -> format of date - '2025-10-09 07:22:20.412' 6. which ever suits best, I don't have a separate table right now 7. no clue for now, but choose for best in terms of scaling 8. That will be managed by service account on dev/uat/prod 9. Daily, with 2 retries for failed tables 10. OK with using external Python libraries
