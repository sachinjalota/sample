Impact	Value / Reason
Speed of AI prototype development – ~70 % reduction vs. ad‑hoc scripts (single API, reusable components).	
Cross‑team adoption – 5+ internal products already consuming the platform (chat assistants, compliance search, call‑center transcription).	
Operational resilience – Celery job‑tracking + rollback guarantees no partial indexes; error‑rate in bulk ingestion < 1 % (validated in test runs).	
Vendor flexibility – Switch from PGVector to Elasticsearch for richer semantic search without code changes; future‑proofed for additional back‑ends.	
Compliance & Governance – All data processing performed in‑house, Guard‑rails enforce policy before LLM output is returned; audit logs stored in PostgreSQL metadata tables.
